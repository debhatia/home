		<h2> The Improvements </h2>
		<p>
			Except for improved graphics and disk-booting support in the ROM, and the removal of the 2k 6502 assembler/disassembler to make room for the floating point
			BASIC, the II+ was otherwise identical to the original II. RAM prices fell during 1980â€“81 and all II+ machines came from the factory with a full 48k of memory 
			already installed. The language card in Slot 0 added another 16k, but it had to be bank switched since the remaining CPU address space was occupied by the ROMs
			and I/O area. For this reason, the extra RAM in the language card was bank-switched over the machine&rsquo;s built-in ROM, allowing code loaded into the additional 
			memory to be used as if it actually were ROM. Users could thus load Integer BASIC into the language card from disk and switch between the Integer and Applesoft
			dialects of BASIC with DOS 3.3&rsquo;s INT and FP commands just as if they had the BASIC ROM expansion card. The language card was also required to use the UCSD Pascal
			and FORTRAN 77 compilers, which were released by Apple at about the same time. These ran under the UCSD p-System operating system, which had its own disk format
			and emitted code for a &ldquo;virtual machine&rdquo; rather than the actual 6502 processor.
		</p>
		<h2> The Programming </h2>
		<p> 	
			The Apple II Plus included the Applesoft BASIC programming language in ROM. This Microsoft-authored dialect of BASIC, which was previously available as an upgrade
			, supported floating-point arithmetic (though it ran at a noticeably slower speed than Steve Wozniak's Integer BASIC) and became the standard BASIC dialect on the Apple.
